# Multiplicative Persistence Calculator
This is a multiplicative persistence calculator made in Python.

## Background Information

Multiplicative persistence is where you keep multiplying the digits of a number togther, until a single digit is obtained. The number of times you need to multiply the digits of a number to get to a single digit is called the persistence.

> Example:
>   1. Take a number: 22
>   2. Multiply the digits togther: 2 x 2 = 4
>   3. We have reached a single digit: 4
>   4. The number of times we had to multiply the digits to get a single digit was: 1
>   5. Therefore, the multiplicative persistence of 22 is: 1

## How To Run

Run `python3 multiplicative-persistence-calculator.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.
